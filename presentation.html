						Parede is the masonry speciali</h1>
					<p>With more than 35 years of experience, our company, Parede, was founded in 1978, by Mr. Jean-Luc SEDE, wishing to make available to all building professionals his new concept of subcontracting in general masonry.						<br/><br/>

						Gradually, the company became more autonomous, able to manage its own sites thanks to professionals from all trades in the building. Thus, it has developed its technical know-how and human skills in areas, such as those of new construction, renovation or for the rehabilitation of buildings or housing						<br/><br/>

						Located in the 4th arrondissement of Marseille, we operate in Aix-en-Provence, Aubagne, La Ciotat, Martigues, in all the cities of the Bouches-du-Rhône department and in those of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region. , in the old or in the new, whether you are professionals or individuals.						<br/><br/>
